# PN532 Passthrough Mode

It is recommended to update the firmware to the latest version before use.

All HINATA series have a `PN532 Passthrough Mode`, which can be connected to a third-party host computer ecosystem for analyzing and writing IC cards.

No settings are required; the card reader will automatically recognize the scenario and enable `PN532 Passthrough Mode`.
