   ![test0](assets/test0.png)

2. Depending on the game's operation method, select `Aimeカードリーダーテスト`  
   ![test1](assets/test1.png)

3. After entering, you can perform **card reading tests** and **LED tests**

::: tip
After closing Segatools' Aime hook, if **both the software/hardware version numbers in the top two rows show no content** in this test interface, it means the game **has not successfully connected to the reader**.
