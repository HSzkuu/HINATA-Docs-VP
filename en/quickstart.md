# Quick Start

## Unboxing
By default, users will receive:
* **HINATA** * 1
* USB Type-C Cable * 1
* Mifare Classic 1k sak:0x08 Blank Card * 1

## What Needs to Do
### 1. Connect to the Computer
Connect HINATA to the computer using a USB Type-C Cable.<br>When HINATA is powered on, a yellow light will turn on, and once successfully connected to the computer, it will gradually turn blue.

At this point, the HINATA device should appear in Windows `Device Manager`.

### 2. Write Aime Access Code to the Provided Card
Only the Standard Edition includes the card.
The blank card requires a Access Code to be written on it for use in SEGA games.
If you already have an `Aime` card, `Banapass` card, or `Amusement IC` card and do not wish to use the provided blank card, you may **skip** this step.

For writing instructions, see: [Card Reading and Writing](HCP/index.md#card-reading-and-writing).
